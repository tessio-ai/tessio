# Changelog

All notable changes to Tessio are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) from `1.0.0` onward.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Relicensed the open core to AGPL-3.0-only** (previously Elastic License 2.0). The `ee/`
  directory is now under a separate commercial license. See `LICENSING.md`.

### Added

- **Open-core structure.** Commercial features live in `ee/` (`@tessio/ee-server`,
  `@tessio/ee-web`) under a one-directional import boundary enforced by ESLint — core never
  imports `ee/`.
- **Entitlements layer** (`@tessio/entitlements`): edition (`TESSIO_EDITION`, default
  `community`) and per-feature flags. Features are gated by edition, **never by seat count** —
  every edition ships unlimited agents. New `GET /api/v1/me/entitlements` endpoint.
- **SSO / OIDC** and the **audit-log viewer** are now Enterprise features (extracted to `ee/`);
  the Community edition runs without them, and the audit *writer* stays in core so events are
  still recorded.
- **Provider-agnostic LLM access** with bring-your-own-key support via environment
  (`TESSIO_AI_PROVIDER`, `TESSIO_AI_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `TESSIO_AI_BASE_URL`,
  `TESSIO_AI_MODEL`, `TESSIO_AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`). `openai-compatible` + a base URL points Tess
  at Azure OpenAI, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, or a local model for **zero outbound egress**. A
  usage-metering seam is in place (no-op in self-host).
- Community health files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  issue/PR templates, and a CLA Assistant workflow.

### Database

- Migration `0027`: adds `provider` and `base_url` columns to `ai_settings`.
